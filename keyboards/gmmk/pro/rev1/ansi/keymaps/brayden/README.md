# braydenalex's GMMK Pro layout
Pretty much the stock layout with a few features added as I needed. Such as a gaming layer with SOCD/Null Bind and a layer for Mac.

 **Features**:
 - Gaming Layer:
	 - SOCD/Null Bind on WASD
	 - Color change on active layer
	 - Disabled Windows Key
 - Caps Lock sidebar and key color change
